PHP Opcode Analysis Kit

A set of Docker images to test out PHP code against the interpreter to see the resulting opcodes with multiple PHP versions.

# Usage

Edit the `test.php` file with the code you would like to test. From there, run the bash/PowerShell script to build the containers and test the code. 

## Linux

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Windows

```powershell
.\run.ps1
```

Contributions are always welcome and happy testing!
